# iOS platform glue

Tawara on iOS is `crates/mobile`'s `tawara` binary as the app bundle's
executable, with an `Info.plist` made from `Info.plist.in`: no Xcode
project, storyboard, Swift or Objective-C (docs/DECISIONS.md D4, D32).
Bundle identifier: `com.patricksmithlaravel.tawara` (D8).

- `Info.plist.in`: the bundle's keys, among them the scene manifest
  without which UIKit stops an app linked with the iOS 27 SDK at launch
  (D32 item 8); `tawara.sh` fills in the platform, the minimum system and
  the version.
- `tawara.sh`: `device` (built and linked for a phone; installing it needs
  signing, phase 5's) and `simulator` (bundled, signed ad hoc, run on a
  simulator with the checks CI runs, `.github/workflows/mobile.yml`).

What the Rust side does (`crates/mobile/src/ios.rs`): the store under
`Library/Application Support/Tawara`, made mode `0700`, protected with
`NSFileProtectionComplete` (D32 item 3) and excluded from iCloud and device
backups with `NSURLIsExcludedFromBackupKey` (docs/PLAN.md section 4.5); the
pasteboard; a cover over the window whenever the application is not active,
so the app switcher's snapshot shows nothing (section 4.3); the lock
when it enters the background; and winit's window put in the window scene
UIKit connects, since winit 0.30 has no scene support of its own (D32
item 8).

Phase 5's signed build adds the `com.apple.developer.default-data-protection`
entitlement, so that every file the application makes is protected from
the start, not only those under the folder `tawara.sh` checks.

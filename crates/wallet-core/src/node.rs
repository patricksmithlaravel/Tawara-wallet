//! The node the wallet asks (docs/PLAN.md section 4.8).
//!
//! - **There is no default node.** The person chooses whom to trust, as with
//!   the command line's `--node`; until they do, the worker opens a store
//!   without reconciling it and says why.
//! - **TLS is required.** `https://` is accepted, and `http://` only to the
//!   loopback interface (`127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`, `localhost`): the node's
//!   answers drive reconciliation and the amounts a spend is built from, and
//!   on a plaintext link anyone on the path can rewrite them. The command
//!   line has an `--allow-plaintext-node` override; the plan gives this
//!   wallet none (docs/DECISIONS.md D22).
//! - **Trust roots.** The library's transport is `ureq` over `rustls` with
//!   the bundled `webpki-roots`, the command-line wallet's. Choosing the
//!   platform's roots instead is a library change (D22).
//!
//! The worker never builds a transport itself: it asks a [`Connect`], so the
//! tests can hand it a scripted chain and the application the real one,
//! [`HttpsNode`].

//! Entropy from the operating system's generator (docs/PLAN.md section 4.4).
//!
//! The library takes every random input as a parameter and has no generator
//! of its own: the phrase entropy, the store's salt and the nonce seed when
//! a store is created, and a fresh nonce seed each time one is opened. This
//! is where Tawara draws them.
//!
//! # The mechanism (docs/DECISIONS.md D20)
//!
//! `getrandom` 0.2, the crate `ring` already uses for TLS keys, so it is in
//! every build of this crate on every platform. What it calls:
//!
//! | platform | call |
//! |---|---|
//! | Windows | `BCryptGenRandom` with `BCRYPT_USE_SYSTEM_PREFERRED_RNG`, as the command-line wallet calls it |
//! | Linux, Android | the `getrandom` system call, which waits until the kernel's pool is initialised; `/dev/urandom` only on kernels without it |
//! | macOS | `getentropy` |
//! | iOS | `CCRandomGenerateBytes` (CommonCrypto, in libSystem; `SecRandomCopyBytes` calls into it) |
//!
//! The command-line wallet reads `/dev/urandom` by path on Unix. The system
//! call draws from the same pool and refuses to answer before it is seeded,
//! which reading the device does not; on Android and iOS it also needs no
//! file access in the sandbox.
//!
//! Every failure is an error. A short or failed draw is never replaced by
//! anything weaker, and the buffer is zeroized when it is dropped.

//! What the node's explorer endpoints say, as the interface shows it:
//! a tag's transactions from the node's index (Activity, docs/SCREENS.md
//! W10), the newest blocks and the size of the node's queue (the wallet's
//! network card, W1), and the explorer's own pages: the chain and the queue
//! (E1), a block (E2), a tag (E3) and a transaction (E4).
//!
//! The rows are the library's (`mesh::codec`), read with the command
//! line's own calls (`cli::cmd_recent_transactions_from`, `cli::cmd_blocks`,
//! `cli::cmd_mempool`, `cli::cmd_block`, `cli::cmd_transaction`) or their
//! walks made in the worker, and every read carries the library's page for
//! it, word for word. What
//! the interface works out from a row (which way it moved, by how much, for
//! one account) follows the command line's page for the same rows
//! (`cli::render`, `recent_transactions`), which is private there and so
//! repeated here, as the worker repeats the command line's other private
//! decisions (docs/DECISIONS.md D19).

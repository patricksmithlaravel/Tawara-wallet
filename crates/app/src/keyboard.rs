//! Showing the soft keyboard again on a tap of the field that holds the focus
//! (docs/DECISIONS.md D32 item 10 (e)).
//!
//! The shell asks the platform for the keyboard only when a field asks for it
//! on a frame when none asked on the frame before: iced's window calls
//! `set_ime_allowed(true)` on the change from no request, and a focused text
//! input asks on every redraw. When the person hides the keyboard, with
//! Android's Back, or it goes away when the app comes back from the
//! background, the field that keeps the focus goes on asking, so a tap on it
//! brings no change to the request, and the shell asks the platform for
//! nothing.
//!
//! `reshow` answers that in Tawara's own code, and the fork does not change.
//! When a finger goes down on a field that holds the focus both before and
//! after the page has the touch, and the safe area reports no keyboard, the
//! field's request on the next frame is withheld. The shell then sees no
//! request on that frame, so it lets the keyboard go, and the field's request
//! on the frame after is a change again, so the shell asks for the keyboard.
//! The field keeps its focus, its caret and its text, and no message is sent.
//!
//! Two passes of one frame's update share the frame's instant, and the shell
//! makes the second pass when the first produced a message or changed the
//! layout: the withholding holds for both, so the frame's request stays
//! withheld. A mouse has no soft keyboard, so a mouse press is not looked at.
//! Android reports the keyboard's height up to about 250 milliseconds after
//! the keyboard appears, so a tap just after it shows may hide it and show it
//! again once.

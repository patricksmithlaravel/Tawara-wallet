//! Paste on a phone: the Paste button beside each field a person pastes into,
//! and the cleaning of what is pasted (docs/DECISIONS.md D32 item 10 (g) and
//! (h)).
//!
//! On a phone iced's fields have no edit menu, so a paste reaches them only
//! from a hardware keyboard (D32 item 9 (g)). On a phone, at any width, a Paste
//! button stands beside each destination field (W4, W8), the signed-bytes
//! field (W9) and the recovery-phrase field (S6), and a Scan button beside
//! each destination (D42 item 1). It reads the platform's
//! clipboard through iced, only on that tap, and what it read replaces what
//! the field held; an empty or refused read changes nothing. Nothing a paste
//! brings is ever submitted. The desktop keeps keyboard paste and shows no
//! button.
//!
//! iced's `text_input` drops every control character of a paste before any
//! hook sees it, so a phrase copied one word to a line would arrive as one
//! long word. The recovery-phrase field alone is wrapped in `phrase_paste`,
//! which hands the field a clipboard whose reads are cleaned by [`spaced`].

//! The test harness: an interface built from an element at a size and driven
//! by hand, with events, operations and drawing, as the runtime drives one.
//! The tests of the widgets and the screens use it, and so does the layout
//! check the phone screens are held to: every node of a screen at 360 logical
//! pixels must lie within the width, and so must the words of every text
//! (docs/DECISIONS.md D32 item 10 (b)). A screen that shows all of its words
//! at once is held further, to the part of its window a person sees between
//! the system's insets, with no page that scrolls and no word wider than its
//! box (`fits_the_viewport`; docs/DECISIONS.md D44).
//!
//! The pointer and the fingers are given in window coordinates, as the shell
//! gives them. Each event carries its position where it has one, and the
//! cursor the interface sees is that position, which is what a scrollable
//! reads a finger's drag from.

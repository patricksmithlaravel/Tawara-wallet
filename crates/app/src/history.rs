//! Activity's rows (docs/SCREENS.md W10): what the node's index holds for

//! (`TransactionView::net` and `direction`, the command line's own sums).
//! What this module adds is the person's word for it: sent, received,
//! between the store's own accounts, or a mining reward. It says nothing a
//! row does not: a reference is the one the index's row carries on a

//! is the store's own record, with no amount, never a row of the index.

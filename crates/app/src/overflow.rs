//! The check that nothing a phone screen draws passes the edge of its window
//! (docs/DECISIONS.md D32 item 10 (b)). The screenshot example's `--fit` and
//! the tests of the screens both use it, so every screen is held to one rule.
//!
//! iced fits each child into the room its parent gives it, so a node that is
//! too wide for its place is clamped to that room and its own box does not
//! pass the edge. The words of a text that cannot break are drawn past their
//! box all the same, so the check reads the width those words need from the
//! paragraph the tree holds for the text. What is reported is what passes the
//! edge: a label squeezed inside a button, with its words still inside the
//! window, is not, since a person cannot see past the edge but can see past a
//! box.
//!
//! [`viewport_problems`] is stricter, for the screens that must show all of
//! their words at once (docs/DECISIONS.md D44): every word stays between the
//! insets the system leaves, the page does not scroll, and every word fits the
//! box it is drawn in, so that a word wider than its cell is reported.

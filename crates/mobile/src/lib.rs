//! Tawara for Android and iOS: the entry points the platforms start, and
//! the glue each needs (docs/DECISIONS.md D32).
//!
//! The same `tawara-app` runs here as on the desktop, through
//! [`tawara_app::run_in`] with a [`tawara_app::Host`]: the app-private
//! directory, the platform's clipboard and Android's Back. What else each
//! platform needs is done before the application starts or from the
//! platform's own notices:
//!
//! - **Android** ([`android`]): `FLAG_SECURE` on the whole window (D32 item
//!   4); the store in `no_backup/` (D21), which the manifest's backup rules
//!   also exclude (platform/android); the lock when the system suspends the
//!   application, from iced's patched shell (D32 item 6).
//! - **iOS** ([`ios`]): the store in Application Support, protected with
//!   `NSFileProtectionComplete` and excluded from backups (D32 item 3); a
//!   cover over the window whenever the application is not active, so the
//!   app switcher's snapshot shows nothing; the lock when it enters the
//!   background.
//!
//! Nothing here is Java, Kotlin, Swift or Objective-C (docs/DECISIONS.md
//! D4): the platform calls are made from Rust, through JNI on Android and
//! the Objective-C runtime on iOS.
